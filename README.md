# hello-world
My first experience with Git. I think this is a nice distraction.

I first need an idea for a project.
This specific project is just to learn about Github and actually use Git.

Why do I always find software thatI like and then want to find a project to use it on????? 

Shouldn't it be the other way around??

So who am I?

I am a guy in a completely different field that wants to learn more about computer science and coding etc etc. I think there is a lot my profession can learn from this. Our processes don't use the latest technology and our coding is rough and ready and difficult to maintain.
